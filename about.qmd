I'm Anna Shao.

I enjoy having fun with 2D visual art and journaling. I find that visual art tends to be a pretty inaccessible art form compared to say, music or film, so I'm challenging myself to incorporate more visual art into my life.

Beyond doing art, I am a college student (as of 2024) who is actively exploring biology, computer science, and other random interests.

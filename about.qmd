# About

My name is Anna Shao (or 'anna banana' as some friends like to say it :)

I'm just having some fun with 2D visual art and journaling. I find that visual art tends to be a pretty inaccessible art form comparatively, so I'm challenging myself to incorporate more visual art into my life.

While doing art, I also happen to be a college student (as of 2024). I'm actively exploring biology, computer science, and other random interests.

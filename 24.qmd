8.2024 I went on my first cruise. The degree of true relaxation was unimaginable; it was quite the definition of a vacation that I haven't had time for in these past years. There were absolutely no obligations, especially since I had no WiFi.

I felt like I broke a rule by keeping the outlines in art. I was too familiar with the customs in realism.

My first digital painting was this adorable dog. I've been meaning to try digital art for the longest time, but I finally got around to it when I was tired of other busy work. So maybe the assignment was a blessing and a curse? I ended up using only one airbrush, hence the more dreamy vibe.
